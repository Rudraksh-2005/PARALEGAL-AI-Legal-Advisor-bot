The\\noath  register is by the incumbent signed as Prime  Minister\\nand all other ministers sign as Ministers. He further  indi-\\ncates that describing Shri Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister\\nis  descriptive only and for all purposes he is  a  Minister\\nand there is no\\n3\\nconstitutional sanction for the post of Deputy Prime  Minis-\\nter as such.\\n    Relying on a bench decision of this Court in the case of\\nVirji Ram Sutaria v.

      "\n",
      "1. The petitioner himself did not press the main point of contention.\n",
      "2. The oath administered to the respondent as Deputy Prime Minister was not considered problematic since it did not confer any power beyond that of a regular minister. The description of him as Deputy Prime Minister was deemed as descriptive and not constitutional in nature.\n",

      "Question: What is the difference between an appeal and a review?\n",
      "Answer:  Based on the provided context, there's no information about appeals or reviews mentioned in it. However, both appeals and reviews are legal procedures within a judicial system. An appeal typically occurs when a higher court reviews the decision of a lower court to ensure that any errors were not made during the trial process. On the other hand, a review is usually an examination of the administrative decisions made by government agencies or public bodies, often to determine if they followed proper procedures or violated any laws. Without more specific context, I can't provide a comparison between appeals and reviews based on the given information.\n",
